# PyBer-Analysis
## Project Overview
The goal of this prject was to create a filtered summary of our ride-sharing-data. I filtered by the city types that we were given (urban, suburban and rural and then plotted the data onto a line graph to show how the weekly fares stacked up over a few months.

This is the line graph that was shown after the data had been filtered:

As we can see, the total fares vary greatly between the cites with urban and suburban areas being far above the average total fares for the rural areas we took a look at. No doubt, it is likely related to the population in these areas being higher than a typical rural areas and locations that people choose to frequent are usually much closer in city areas.

### Conclusion
I have a few suggestions for potentially increasing the amount of revenue from both the rural and the suburban areas; the first being adding in a discounted fare for people who would need to travel a long distance in the ride-share vehicle. If the cost for purchasing a ride-share isn't so steep that the customer doesn't even see the value in it, they likely won't buy in. By lowering the value on longer drives, you're offering more incentive for those who live far away to purchase a ride-share and in a way that doesn't affect urban areas in a negative way. The second suggestion would be to increase the amount of drivers that are going out to the rural areas, part of the revenue disparity is as simple as a supply and demand correlation, there simply aren't enough ride-shares available for people on the outskirts of the cities. My final suggestion would be to offer some sort of reward system to the customers based on the amount of miles that they travel in a ride-share, similar to airline miles. That way people who do have to travel further in a ride-share and therefore spend more money, feel like they're getting their worth out of it with things like $5 credits or free rides passed a certain number of miles attained. There are a number of ways to play with a reward system to get the most out of it and I think it could really tap into a lost market for any ride-share company.
